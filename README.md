# Card Manager - A ReactJS Web Application

Card Manager is a web application built using ReactJS that allows users to create, edit, and organize their cards. With Card Manager, users can:

- Create, edit, and delete cards, each of which contains a name and a video or MP3 link.
- Create and manage buckets to categorize their cards. Users can name their buckets however they like.
- Move cards between buckets as needed.
- Play videos by clicking on a card, which opens a modal with an iframe.
- Delete single or multiple cards within a bucket at once.
- View their playback history, which lists the MP3/MP4 links they have played, along with the card name and the time the link was played.
